We're moving!

We promised interesting news, here they are.

At the beginning of this year, we were bored and happy that we could visit Spejs at any time, talk to interesting people, play some games or work on our projects.

From time to time, however, it felt like it was getting tight. In particular: the new tools we wanted to introduce didn't really have a place to live. Theoretically, we have not yet reached the peak of our capacity to fill HS. In practice, we felt that HS should be something more than a warehouse... Conclusion: we could use "a little more" than the space we had.

Our "a little more" is taking shape.

As befits DIY hackers and Adam Słodowy fans, we went to the garage. The extra space was a hit! This workshop gave us an additional 21 m^2 and space to work with wood, metal, resin... and everything that is noisy and dusty.

It's time for the next step. In the near future we plan to move our "clean" belongings to ~80m^2. By "next time" we mean... next weekend :D

From ~45m^2 to ~100m^2 in less than a year! The space was used absolutely in every inch for development and work on our projects.

We want to thank you for this. It's for you and thanks to you we do all this. This is OUR COMMON, friendly, helpful and open space. It's great to be part of such a creative hacker community!

What does this move mean for you?

More space for projects. More space for new tools that we can use together. More opportunities to organize meetings, workshops, hackathons, etc. And maybe more pizza tables...

New opportunities also mean new dreams and new desires. If you would like to add something to our collective studio, take a look at what is on [Chciejlista](https://hs3.pl/zasoby/chciejlista/).

Maybe you have some equipment that you don't use very often and which you would like to share with other hackers. Sharing knowledge and sharing tools is one of the foundations of every hackerspace.

And what is most important: our space is growing, but we are not changing the address. Next we are at Wojska Polskiego 41.

We invite you to visit!
